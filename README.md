## Task 01: Temperature Converter

A simple Python program that converts temperature values between Kelvin (K), Celsius (C), and Fahrenheit (F). The program prompts the user to enter a temperature and select the units to convert from and to. It performs the necessary calculation and returns the converted value

## SkillCraft Technology Internship Task

This project was developed as part of my Software Development Internship at SkillCraft Technology. It helped improve my Python programming skills and problem-solving abilities by creating a real-world utility tool.
----------------------------------

----------------------------------
## Features

- Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin
- Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin
- Convert Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenhe
- Provides a text menu interface for easy user interaction
----------------------------------
## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Run the script from the command line or terminal:
python SC_SD_1.py
----------------------------
## How It Works
1. The user runs the program and is prompted to enter the current temperature value.

2. The user inputs the unit of the temperature they entered (K for Kelvin, C for Celsius, or F for Fahrenheit).

3. The program then asks the user which unit they want to convert the temperature to.

4. Using standard temperature conversion formulas, the program calculates the converted value.

5. The converted temperature is displayed in the target unit.

## Sample Output

Temperature Conversion Program
1. Celsius to Fahrenheit
2. Fahrenheit to Celsius
3. Celsius to Kelvin
4. Kelvin to Celsius
5. Fahrenheit to Kelvin
6. Kelvin to Fahrenheit
Select a conversion (1-6): 1
Enter temperature in Celsius: 25
25.0 °C = 77.0 °F
